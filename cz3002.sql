Through comprehensive academic and co-curricular programmes, anchored on student centric and values-driven learning, we hope to nurture the students to achieve their potential. At the end of their 6 years in MPS, we want to see our students grow to become Responsible Learners and Compassionate Leaders ready to serve community and nation as active young citizens.

This is espoused in our Citizenship and Character Education or CCE#s vision of #Every Marsilian a Service Leader and Green Citizen#.   To foster a student-centric, values-driven learning environment, CCE in Marsiling Primary is anchored on two core programmes # Values in Action (VIA) and student leadership vis-#-vis Green Citizenship & LEAD to SERVE respectively. VIA is practised through our Green Citizenship programme which engages students in initiating collective actions among peers in doing simple acts of taking care of the school and environment.
